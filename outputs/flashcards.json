      "question": "According to the text, what is the key to understanding a complex 'black box' AI model like a Transformer?",
      "answer": "The key is to understand its simpler, individual components or 'layers,' which are described as being stacked like building blocks. By examining how each layer performs its specific job, we can understand the system as a whole.",
      "hint": "Think about how you would understand any complex machine. Do you look at it all at once, or do you examine its individual parts?",

      "id": 2,
      "question": "In a single layer of a feedforward network, what distinct roles do 'weights' and 'biases' play in transforming a piece of data?",
      "answer": "'Weights' act like adjustable gears that precisely scale or modify the data. After that, 'biases' provide a consistent nudge or 'energy boost.' This two-step process refines the information before it passes to the next layer.",
      "hint": "One is described as precisely adjusting the data, while the other gives it a simple, consistent 'nudge.'",

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the concept of 'rescaling symmetry' in a Transformer, and what does it reveal about the model's operations?",
      "answer": "Rescaling symmetry is a property where a model's internal parameters (weights and biases) can be drastically changed, yet the final output remains exactly the same. This reveals the model has a deep internal flexibility and is not dependent on one specific set of values to reach the right conclusion.",
      "hint": "Consider the relationship between the *internal* state of the model and its *final* result. Are they always rigidly linked?",
      "topic": "Self-Attention and Symmetry",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },

      "id": 4,
      "question": "The text outlines three main benefits of understanding the deep structure of AI. What is the key takeaway for our ability to create future AI?",
      "answer": "The key takeaway is that this deep understanding allows us to move from simply *using* AI to intelligently *designing* novel and more powerful architectures for the future.",
      "hint": "The answer focuses on how this knowledge changes our role from being a user to being a creator or architect.",
